# Utils

Every model / class extends from the Utils class. This is useful for sharing data filtering and processing functions.  
The functions of this class are as follows:

## getData
This function allows two possibilities depending on how we use it:

- Use it as a function without parameters, which will return an 
object with the values of the class and its keys according to the model of the constructor.
For Example:
```javascript
const model = {name: '', surname: '', hobbies: []};
const Instance = new NameOfClass(model);
Instance.name = 'any string';
Instance.getData();
/** Output:
* 
* {
*   name: 'any string',
*   surname: '',
*   hobbies: [] 
* }
* 
* */
```

- Filter by keys, which will return an object with the values of the class and its keys 
according to the array of strings passed as parameter.
For Example ( Follow the previous example)
```javascript
Instance.getData('name'); //{ name: 'any string' }

Instance.getData(['name','hobbies']); //{ name: 'any string', hobbies: [] }

/** It doesn't return keys no included in model */
Instance.getData(['name','hobbies', 'props']); //{ name: 'any string', hobbies: [] }
```

## filter
Filter by keys, which will return an object with the values of the class and its keys 
according to the array of strings passed as parameter.
It's like use *Instance.getData(**parameters**)*, so the example it's the same too.

## toJson 
Simply, return a JSON object with the values of the class and its keys according to the model of the constructor.
It's like use *Instance.getData()*, so the example it's the same too.
