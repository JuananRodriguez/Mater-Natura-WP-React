# Models

All the data management of the application is done through classes created from models, 
which we find in the src/models folder.

As a rule, every model will extend the Utils.js class, which provides the model in 
question with functions for its handling ( to Json(), filter(), getData()... ) 

On the other hand, the constructor of the model is also atypical. we will use an array 
of object (each attribute of the class) that we will pass to the constructor of Utils 
(Super) which will be the one in charge of creating our class correctly.

Any other function or attibutes of the class must be created in the same class. 
For example, the translations of the keys of the attributes.

You can see the functions contained in the utils class in the documentation, 
in Utils, and how to create a new class correctly in How to create new model.
